File-Pruner
=========

This utility prunes unecessary data from supported filetypes. Right now it only supports .big files (actually .wav files) because this is what I needed it for and I threw it together in an hour.

Launch it using `pruner /path/to/folder/containing/.big/files/`. It outputs the pruned files and their old unnecessary header in `./output`.

It should work fine on all modern OS.
